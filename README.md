# NotDog
> "What would you say if I told you there is a app on the market that tell you if you have a dog or not a dog. It is very good and I do not want to work on it any more. You can hire someone else." - Jian Yang, 2017

[NotDog](https://not-dog-io.firebaseapp.com) is the Shazam of animals. It is based on the [Not HotDog app](https://www.seefoodtechnologies.com/nothotdog/) developed by See Food Technologies.

The application uses [ML Kit for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml-kit) to tell if you have a dog or not.
